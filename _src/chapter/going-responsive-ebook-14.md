There’s nothing like writing a book to make you appreciate the kindness and wisdom of your colleagues and friends. I’m genuinely lucky to know so many smart people and I’m genuinely grateful for all the help I received during this process.

To Jeffrey Zeldman, Jason Santa Maria, Nicole Fenton, Caren Litherland, Lisa Maria Martin, Rob Weychert, and the entire team at A Book Apart, thank you for agreeing to go through this whole goat rodeo with me a second time. Special thanks go to Katel LeDû for wrangling a miraculous number of goats at one time—and making it look so easy.

To Frank Chimero, I’m thrilled that you agreed to write the foreword. I’d like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn.

To Jason Grigsby, thank you for ensuring I accurately communicated the nuances of the more complex aspects of responsive design. Anyone who needs help navigating a responsive project would be in good hands with Jason and the Cloud Four team.

To Livia Labate, thank you for generously giving so much of your time for interviews, advice, and reviewing a draft of the book. For my next book, I plan to follow you around and write down all the smart things you say; it will be a best seller.

To Stephen Turbek and Jeff Eaton, thank you both for reading early drafts of my first book, remaining friends with me, and then agreeing to do the same for a second book. You are true friends; there are none finer.

To Selina Andersson, thank you for your cheerful and unflappable help with this book—and nearly everything else in my life. Your assistance in scheduling podcast interviews and confirming quotes was valuable beyond measure. Thanks also to audio editor Aaron Schroeder and transcriber Seth Lavelle—two people I’ve never met, but who have suffered through endless hours listening to my recorded voice (and the sirens from the emergency room down the block.)

To Alex Breuer, Bill Scott, Brandon Rosage, Brian Dillon, Brian Greene, Brian Hurley, Chris Balt, Dave Augustine, Emily Smith, Eoin Comerford, Frank Punzo, Jason Chandler, Jeremy Keith, Joe Stewart, Justin McDowell, Kalpita Kothary, Kevin Ackley, Mandy Brown, Miguel Gomez, Mike Donahue, Mike Monteiro, Monika Piotrowicz, Niko Vijayaratnam, Nishant Kothary, Patrick Cooper, Perry Hewitt, Robert Huddleston, Robert Petro, Ryan Shafer, Sarah Thompson, Scher Foord, Scott Childs, Scott Kelton Jones, Suzanne Connaughton, Tina Alexander, Todd Hodgson, Trei Brundrett, Tyler Fleck, and Zach Seward, thank you for sharing what you’ve learned from going responsive—your insights make the case more effectively than I ever could. Gratitude also goes out to every guest on the Responsive Web Design Podcast—your perspective helped shape this book, even if I didn’t quote you directly.

To Aaron Parkening and Eileen Webb, thank you both for being so delightful to work with. I wanted to memorialize in a book just how great you are.

Remember sitcoms from the ’80s and how the real star of the show’s name appeared last in the credits? Thanks to Ethan Marcotte, for so many different reasons. Thank you for flying all over the world with me to help companies do better at responsive design. Thank you for not laughing at me when I suggested we host a podcast. Thank you for your insightful feedback on an absurdly early draft of this book and for not blocking me on Slack when I asked you yet another question about user agent detection on a Sunday morning. Thank you for inventing the damn thing. You’ve made my life—and the web—a much better place.

To my family, thanks for letting me be who I am without question. To all my friends (you know who you are), thanks for making me feel like I’m at home in every city I visit.
