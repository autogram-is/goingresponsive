IT’S DIFFICULT TO get your arms around the web, because it doesn’t have any edges. I mean this in a few different ways. First, the web’s structure is made up of links on top of links, so it sprawls out in every direction. Second, the screens we use to access the web can scroll every which way, offering us rivers of news, status updates, emails, and—admit it—puppy photos. And, more recently, those of us who make things for the web have had to devise strategies that support an ever-increasing glut of devices, screen sizes, and contexts. Normally, this amount of variability would drive a person mad with complications—and, believe me, it did that to many of us. But this complexity was the sign of opportunity. Along came responsive design, which turned an untenable situation into a chance to re-conceive what we make for the web. I suspect you’ve heard all about this, and that’s why you’re holding this book.

Fortunately for you, there is no finer person to guide you along than Karen McGrane. She’s been keeping her hands on the warm clay of the web for twenty years. The range of her expertise is important. As you dive into your responsive project, you’ll notice how deeply braided together content, presentation, and development are in your decision-making process. No choices happen independently. Remember: there are no edges, so all your decisions live in several places in many forms. And there’s no better way to learn how to navigate these choices than to be introduced by someone who understands all the elements at play and can speak across the disciplines. That’s Karen.

Responsive projects require clear goals, frequent communication, and solid collaboration. This leads me to the last way the web encourages edgelessness—it blurs the lines between the disciplines that make the web. Yet again, a complexity offers us a new opportunity: by making things for others, we get to learn how to better work with each other. This is the true benefit of going responsive. I can't wait to see what you make.
